<li>AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) is an open-source framework that extends AWS CloudFormation to simplify the deployment and management of serverless applications on AWS. AWS SAM provides a simplified syntax and model for defining serverless resources, such as AWS Lambda functions, Amazon API Gateway endpoints, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon S3 buckets, and can be used with the AWS SAM CLI (Command Line Interface) to package and deploy the serverless applications. AWS SAM also supports the integration with other AWS services and resources, such as AWS X-Ray, AWS CloudWatch, and AWS CodeDeploy, and provides templates and examples for common use cases and scenarios. AWS SAM is part of the AWS Serverless offering, which includes other services such as AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, and AWS EventBridge.</li>
<li>The benefits of using AWS SAM over traditional infrastructure management include faster development and deployment cycles, lower operational costs and overhead, better scalability and availability, and improved security and compliance. With AWS SAM, you can focus on the business logic and application code, and let AWS handle the infrastructure and runtime management. AWS SAM also provides features such as automatic scaling, fine-grained access control, and automatic backup and recovery, which can help you to optimize and streamline your serverless applications. Additionally, AWS SAM can be integrated with other AWS services and third-party tools, and can be extended and customized to meet your specific requirements and constraints.</li>
<li>AWS SAM templates are JSON or YAML documents that define the resources and properties of a serverless application, using the AWS SAM model and syntax. AWS SAM templates consist of sections such as Resources, Parameters, Outputs, and Transform, and can include references to other AWS CloudFormation templates and parameters. AWS SAM templates are used with the AWS SAM CLI and the AWS CloudFormation service to create and deploy the serverless applications, and can be customized and extended with macros and plugins. Here is an example of a simple AWS SAM template that defines an AWS Lambda function: </li>

```yaml
Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'
Resources:
  MyFunction:
    Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
    Properties:
      CodeUri: .
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: nodejs16.x
```

<li>AWS SAM CLI commands are a set of command-line tools that allow you to create, package, and deploy serverless applications using AWS SAM templates and the AWS CloudFormation service. AWS SAM CLI commands include sam init to create a new serverless application, sam build to build the application artifacts and dependencies, sam package to create a package of the application and its resources, and sam deploy to deploy the package to an AWS account or region. Other AWS SAM CLI commands include sam local to run and test the serverless application locally, sam logs to view the logs and metrics of the application, and sam validate to validate the AWS SAM template syntax and semantics.</li>
<li>AWS SAM Resource Types are predefined types of serverless resources that can be used in the AWS SAM templates, such as AWS::Serverless::Function, AWS::Serverless::Api, AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable, and AWS::Serverless::StateMachine. AWS SAM Resource Types provide a simplified and standard way of defining and configuring the serverless resources, and can be customized and extended with additional properties and parameters. AWS SAM Resource Types are also supported by the AWS CloudFormation service, and can be used in combination with other CloudFormation resources and templates.</li>
<li>AWS SAM Policy Templates are predefined templates for the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies that can be used to grant or restrict the permissions and access of the serverless resources created by AWS SAM. AWS SAM Policy Templates include templates for commonly used permissions, such as S3 read-only access, DynamoDB read-write access, and CloudWatch log access. AWS SAM Policy Templates provide a standardized and secure way of managing the IAM policies and roles for the serverless applications, and can be customized and extended with additional policies and permissions.</li>

## Level 2: Intermediate

<ol>
<li>How can you use AWS SAM to define and deploy a multi-region, multi-environment serverless application, and manage the infrastructure as code?</li>
<li>How can you use the AWS SAM CodeDeploy and CodePipeline to automate the deployment and release of your serverless applications, and integrate with other AWS services?</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>
<ol>
<li>To define and deploy a multi-region, multi-environment serverless application with AWS SAM, you can use the AWS SAM templates, the AWS CloudFormation service, and the AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy services. You can create multiple AWS SAM templates for each region or environment, and use the AWS CloudFormation StackSets or Nested Stacks to deploy the templates to the corresponding accounts and regions. You can also use the AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy to automate the deployment and testing of the application across multiple stages, such as development, staging, and production, and to integrate with other AWS services and resources, such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS X-Ray.</li>
<li>To automate the deployment and release of your serverless applications and integrate with other AWS services with AWS SAM CodeDeploy and CodePipeline, you can use the AWS SAM templates and the AWS CodeDeploy and CodePipeline services. You can create AWS SAM templates that define the deployment groups and strategies, and use the AWS CodeDeploy to package and deploy the application artifacts and resources. You can also use the AWS CodePipeline to automate the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, and to trigger the deployments and tests based on various criteria and events. Finally, you can use the AWS CloudFormation and AWS S3 as the deployment targets and sources, and to store and version the application artifacts and configurations.</li>
</ol>

## Level 3: Advanced

<ol>
<li>How can you use the AWS SAM Local and Docker to test and debug your serverless applications locally, and emulate the AWS Lambda execution environment?</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<ol>
<li>To test and debug your serverless applications locally with AWS SAM Local and Docker, you can use the AWS SAM CLI and the Docker command line. You can create a Docker image that emulates the AWS Lambda execution environment, and use the AWS SAM CLI to run and test the application inside the container. You can also use the AWS SAM CLI to customize and configure the container settings and parameters, and to simulate various events and scenarios. Finally, you can use the Docker networking and volumes to connect the container to other AWS services and resources, such as AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, and AWS RDS, and to test the application interactions and integrations.</li>
