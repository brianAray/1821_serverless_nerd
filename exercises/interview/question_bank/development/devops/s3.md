<li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a web service that provides scalable and durable object storage in the cloud.</li>
<li>Amazon S3 provides benefits such as scalability, durability, and security, by allowing you to store and retrieve objects of any size or type, from anywhere and at any time, and pay only for the storage and data transfer you use.</li>
<li>The different storage classes in Amazon S3 are: Standard, Standard-Infrequent Access (IA), One Zone-Infrequent Access (Z-IA), Glacier, and Glacier Deep Archive. Each storage class has different features and costs, and is designed for different use cases and access patterns.</li>
<li>An S3 bucket is a container for objects that are stored in Amazon S3, and is identified by a unique name and a region. S3 buckets can be created, configured, and managed using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs.</li>
<li>An S3 object is an entity that is stored in an S3 bucket, and consists of a key (the unique identifier), a value (the data), and metadata (the attributes and properties). S3 objects can be accessed using a unique URL, and can be managed using S3 APIs or console.</li>

<ol>
<li>First an S3 bucket needs to be created with a unique name in a region suitable for the website. Static website hosting must then be enabled through the properties, and a new bucket policy must be applied to allow access to it from public networks. Next upload the static build files of the React app to the bucket, and ensure the index location of the static website is pointed to the right file in the bucket.</li>
