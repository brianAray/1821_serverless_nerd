<ol>
<li>Postman is a popular tool used by developers to simplify the testing and development of APIs. It allows developers to create and send requests to an API, and view the response from the server.</li>
<li>Postman can be installed on your local machine by downloading the appropriate version from the Postman website, and following the installation instructions.</li>
<li>To create a new API request in Postman, you can use the "New" button in the Postman interface, and select the appropriate request type (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).</li>
<li>To add parameters to an API request in Postman, you can use the "Params" or "Body" tabs in the Postman interface, and enter the appropriate parameter values.</li>
<li>To send a request and view the response in Postman, you can use the "Send" button in the Postman interface, and view the response in the "Response" tab.</li>
<li>A Postman collection is a group of related API requests that can be saved and shared. It is often used to organize and simplify the testing of an API.</li>
<li>Postman environments are variables that can be used in API requests to simplify testing and development. They are often used to store the values of frequently-used parameters or authentication tokens.</li>
<li>To save and share Postman requests and collections, you can use the "Export" button in the Postman interface, and select the appropriate file format (e.g., JSON, CSV, HTML).</li>
<li>A Postman variable is a dynamic value that can be used in API requests to simplify testing and development. It can be used to store the values of frequently-used parameters or authentication tokens.</li>
<li>Postman can be used to test authentication and authorization in an API by including the appropriate headers or tokens in the API requests, and verifying that the server responds with the expected data.</li>

## Level 2: Intermediate

<ol>
<li>How do you create a mock server in Postman, and what is its purpose?</li>
<li>What is a Postman test script, and how is it used?</li>
<li>How do you use Postman to test APIs with different response codes and error messages?</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>
<ol>
<li>A mock server in Postman is a server that simulates the behavior of an API. It is often used to test APIs that are not yet available or to test the behavior of an API under different conditions.</li>
<li>A Postman test script is a JavaScript function that is executed after an API request is sent. It can be used to verify that the response from the server meets the expected criteria. For example, a test script can be used to check the response status code, response time, or the content of the response.</li>
<li>Postman can be used to test APIs with different response codes and error messages by sending requests with different parameters, headers, or tokens, and verifying that the server responds with the expected data.</li>
