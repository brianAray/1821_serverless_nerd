<li>SDLC is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software. It is important in software development to ensure that the software meets the requirements of the customer and is of high quality.</li>
<li>The different phases of SDLC include requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. In the requirements gathering phase, the needs of the customer are identified. In the design phase, the architecture of the software is defined. In the development phase, the software is created. In the testing phase, the software is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements. In the deployment phase, the software is released to the customer. In the maintenance phase, the software is updated and maintained.</li>
<li>A requirements document is a document that outlines the requirements for the software product. It is used in SDLC to guide the development team in creating the software product that meets the needs of the customer.</li>
<li>Design is the process of defining the architecture and structure of the software product. It is important in SDLC to ensure that the software is scalable, maintainable, and meets the needs of the customer.</li>
<li>Development is the process of creating the software product. Common development methodologies used in SDLC include Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps.</li>
<li>Testing is the process of verifying that the software meets the requirements and is of high quality. It is important in SDLC to ensure that the software product is free of bugs and meets the needs of the customer.</li>
<li>Deployment is the process of releasing the software product to the customer. It is done in SDLC to ensure that the software product is delivered in a timely manner and meets the needs of the customer.</li>
<li>Maintenance is the process of updating and maintaining the software product. It is important in SDLC to ensure that the software product remains relevant and up-to-date.</li>
<li>The benefits of SDLC include better quality software products, improved collaboration, reduced development time, and increased customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>The main roles in an SDLC team include a project manager, a business analyst, a designer, a developer, a tester, and a deployment and maintenance team.</li>

<ol>
<li>The best SDLC model for a particular project depends on the size and complexity of the project, as well as the needs of the customer. Common models include Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps.</li>
<li>Documentation is important in SDLC to ensure that the development team has a clear understanding of the requirements and architecture of the software product. Best practices for documentation include creating clear, concise, and up-to-date documents.</li>
<li>Changes in requirements during SDLC are handled by the project manager, who is responsible for managing the scope of the project. If a new requirement is added, it may require changes to the requirements document and design documents.</li>
<li>Common challenges faced by SDLC teams include unclear requirements, poor communication, scope creep, and lack of team experience. These challenges can be addressed by adopting best practices for SDLC, such as creating clear and concise documentation, holding regular meetings, and focusing on delivering small, incremental changes.</li>
<li>The success of an SDLC project can be measured by a variety of metrics, including the quality of the software, the satisfaction of the customer, and the time-to-market. Metrics can be tracked using tools such as bug tracking software, customer satisfaction surveys, and project management software.</li>

## Level 3: Advanced

<ol>
<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of different SDLC models, such as Waterfall, Agile, and DevOps?</li>
<li>How do you ensure the security of a software product during SDLC?</li>
<li>What are the common anti-patterns in SDLC, and how can they be avoided?</li>
</ol>

<li>Waterfall is a more sequential and rigid SDLC model, while Agile is a more flexible and iterative model. DevOps is focused on collaboration between development and operations teams. The advantages and disadvantages of each model depend on the needs of the project and the customer.</li>
<li>Ensuring the security of a software product during SDLC involves implementing security measures throughout the entire process, from requirements gathering to deployment. Common security measures include data encryption, access control, and regular security audits.</li>
<li>Anti-patterns in SDLC are common mistakes or bad practices that can hinder the success of a project. These may include poor communication, lack of planning, and over-engineering. To avoid anti-patterns, it is important to adopt best practices for SDLC and to continuously evaluate and improve the team's performance.</li>
