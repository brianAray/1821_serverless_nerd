<li>Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is used in software development to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently.</li>
<li>The key principles of Agile include delivering working software frequently, collaborating with customers and stakeholders, embracing change, and maintaining a focus on people and their interactions.</li>
<li>A sprint is a timeboxed period of development in Agile. It typically lasts two to four weeks, and is used to deliver a working product increment.</li>
<li>A user story is a description of a feature or function that is written from the perspective of a user. It is used to capture the requirements for the feature and to communicate them to the development team.</li>
<li>A product backlog is a prioritized list of features or functions that are required for a product. It is used to guide the development team in the creation of the product.</li>
<li>A sprint backlog is a list of user stories that the development team plans to complete during a sprint. It is used to guide the work of the team during the sprint.</li>
<li>A daily stand-up is a short, daily meeting where the development team discusses their progress and plans for the day. It is used to ensure that everyone is on the same page and to identify any potential roadblocks.</li>
<li>A retrospective is a meeting that is held at the end of a sprint to review the team's performance and identify areas for improvement.</li>
<li>The benefits of Agile include increased flexibility, improved collaboration and communication, faster time-to-market, and increased customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>The main roles in an Agile team include a product owner, a Scrum master, and a development team.</li>

## Level 2: Intermediate

<ol>
<li>How do you estimate the time required for each user story in Agile?</li>
<li>What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall methodologies?</li>
<li>How do you prioritize items in the product backlog?</li>
<li>How do you handle changes in requirements during a sprint?</li>
<li>What are the common challenges faced by Agile teams, and how can they be addressed?</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>
<ol>
<li>In Agile, the time required for each user story is estimated using story points. Story points are a measure of the complexity of the story, and are typically estimated using a consensus-based approach, such as Planning Poker.</li>
<li>Agile is a more flexible and iterative approach to software development, while Waterfall is a more sequential and rigid approach. Agile emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction, while Waterfall emphasizes planning, documentation, and strict phases of development.</li>
<li>Items in the product backlog are prioritized based on their business value and the needs of the customer. The product owner is responsible for prioritizing the items in the backlog.</li>
<li>Changes in requirements during a sprint are handled by the product owner, who is responsible for managing the product backlog. If a new requirement is added during a sprint, it may be added to the product backlog and addressed in a future sprint.</li>
<li>Common challenges faced by Agile teams include unclear requirements, poor communication, scope creep, and lack of team experience. These challenges can be addressed by adopting best practices for Agile, such as writing clear user stories, holding regular meetings, and focusing on delivering small, incremental changes.</li>
</ol>

## Level 3: Advanced

<ol>
<li>What are the different types of Agile frameworks, and how do they differ from each other?</li>
<li>How do you measure the success of an Agile project, and what metrics can be used to track progress?</li>
<li>What are the common anti-patterns in Agile, and how can they be avoided?</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>
<ol>
<li>There are several different types of Agile frameworks, including Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). Each framework has its own set of principles and practices, and may be more suitable for certain types of projects.</li>
<li>The success of an Agile project can be measured by a variety of metrics, including the velocity of the team, the quality of the software, and the satisfaction of the customer. Metrics can be tracked using tools such as burndown charts, velocity charts, and customer satisfaction surveys.</li>
<li>Anti-patterns in Agile are common mistakes or bad practices that can hinder the success of an Agile project. These may include over-engineering, siloed teams, and lack of planning. To avoid anti-patterns, it is important to adopt best practices for Agile and to continuously evaluate and improve the team's performance.</li>
