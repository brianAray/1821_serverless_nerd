# Interview Practice Guide

## Interview Tips

Before diving into the code right away, you interviewer will probably make some small talk, but really they are looking into your background:

- **Confidence** : Do you think you know how to code?
- **Leadership** : Do you finish your code, reach out to others, take charge, etc.
- **Communication** : Is it actually useful to talk through a problem with you?

Things to be aware of before the interview:

- A technical problem you solved
- An example of when you showed leadership
- How you implemented Agile teamwork
- How you have learned coding and improved
- Your thoughts on your batchmates (be positive!)
- What you love about coding (Showing passion is key)

Once you have went through the chit chat (practice with your team, get comfortable talking about yourself). You will normally go into the technical part of the interview. The interviewer is looking for a team member, so make sure you present yourself as a good team member and walk through the code as communicative as possible. For example:

- **Think out loud**
  - Don't be silent, even if you don't know what you are doing, explain your thoughts
  - Being quiet goes against what is a good team player, if your code works it is not what they really want
- **Say you don't know**
  - If you're not sure, ask them, and if you still don't know then just say you need more of an explanation
  - They won't bite your head off, if you don't know then don't just make stuff up
  - Maybe you are not comfortable with that language so explain what you do know with what you are comfortable with
- **Slow down**
  - This isn't a race, you have time
  - Breathe
  - The faster you go, the more likely you are to make a simple mistake
  - Explain what you are doing with each line you write, this will force you to slow down if you find yourself racing through the code
  - When you answer a question, don't just say the right answer, explain it and give examples
  - Remember, you want to be a good team member and being able to explain a technical problem is essential
