# Jest Exercise 1 (Writing Basic Test Cases)

## Description

This exercise involves writing basic test cases using Jest to ensure that a function called `add` works correctly for different input values. This exercise will involve following TDD (Test Driven Development) in which the tests should be completed first, and then the function should be generated to pass the tests.

## Approach

1. Write test cases using Jest to check the function's output for different input values, including positive, negative, and zero values.
2. Use Jest's test and expect functions to define the test cases and to check the functions output.
3. Write a function called add that takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum.

## Hints

1. Use Jest's matchers, such as `toBe` and `not`, to check the output of the `add` function.
2. Write test cases to check the function's behavior when passed positive, negative, and zero input numbers.
3. Remember to test for edge cases, such as when the input is the largest or smallest possible number for a given data type.

## Deliverables

1. A working add function that correctly adds two input values
2. A set of test cases using Jest to verify the output of the add function for different input values
