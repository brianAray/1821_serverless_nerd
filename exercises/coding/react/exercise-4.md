# React Exercise 4 (Implementing React Redux)

## Description

This exercise involves integrating React Redux into the PokemonList and PokemonDetail components. The component should allow users to add Pokemon to their favorites list and display the list of favorite Pokemon.

## Approach

- Install react-redux and redux packages.
- Create a Redux store that manages the state of the Pokemon list and detail pages.
- Define Redux actions and reducers to handle adding Pokemon to the favorites list and displaying the list of favorite Pokemon.
- Create a new React component called FavoritesList that displays the list of favorite Pokemon.
- Allow users to add Pokemon to their favorites list from the PokemonDetail page.
- Use TypeScript to define the type of data being stored in the Redux store.
- Style the FavoritesList component using CSS.

## Hints

- Use createSlice function to create Redux actions and reducers
- Use useDispatch hook to dispatch Redux actions from your components
- Use useSelector hook to access the state from your components
- Use TypeScript interfaces to define the shape of the data being stored in the Redux store
- Refer back to the notes and examples for this exercise to see how to install React Redux and implement it

## Deliverables

- A working PokemonList and PokemonDetail component with React Redux integration
