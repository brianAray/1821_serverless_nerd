# Array Exercises
Please look up documentation on these methods if you are unfamiliar with how they can be used (ex. splice)

1. Use the .push() method to add the numbers 5, 6, and 7 to the end of the array [1, 2, 3, 4].
2. Use the .pop() method to remove the last element from the array [1, 2, 3, 4] and console.log the new array.
3. Use the .shift() method to remove the first element from the array [1, 2, 3, 4] and console.log the new array.
4. Use the .unshift() method to add the number 0 to the beginning of the array [1, 2, 3, 4].
5. Use the .slice() method to create a new array containing the elements from index 2 to index 4 of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
6. Use the .splice() method to add the number 100 at index 2 of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
7. Use the .splice() method to remove the element at index 3 of the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
8. Use the .concat() method to join the arrays [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] together into a new array.
9. Use the .join() method to join all elements of the array ["I", "am", "learning", "JS"] into a string, using a space as the separator.
10. Use the .indexOf() method to find the index of the string "banana" in the array ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi"].
11. Use the .indexOf() method to find the index of the number 7 in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
12. Use the .includes() method to check if the string "kiwi" is present in the array ["apple", "banana", "orange"].
13. Use the .includes() method to check if the number 5 is present in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9].
14. Create an array of numbers and use .map to create a new array that contains the square of each number.
15. Create an array of strings and use .map to create a new array that contains the length of each string.
16. Create an array of objects and use .filter to create a new array that contains only the objects that have a specific property with a certain value.
17. Create an array of words and use .filter to create a new array that contains only the words that have more than a certain number of letters.
