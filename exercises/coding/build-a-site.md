# Build a 90s Website
This exercise requires you to build a 90's website. It should look terrible, because that's how early websites actually looked like. The objective of this exercise is to have you experiment with HTML elements and see how they appear in the web browser, and also get practice with using Git branches and making use of Github pull requests.

1. Don't use any CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Bulma (you can utilize CSS though, if you're already familiar with CSS, no worries if you're not)
2. Don't use any JS (early websites were very "dumb", as in they couldn't really perform much actual dynamic functionality and rendering like modern websites today)

## Github Practice
As you're working on your webpages, get into the habit of creating Git branches for each new "section" of the webpage you are adding

1. Create a new branch using `git branch <branch name>`
2. Switch to the new branch using `git checkout <branch name>`
3. Make changes to your files, add new files, etc.
4. Use `git add <file name>`, `git commit -m "<commit message>"`, etc.
5. Push the branch to Github using `git push -u origin <branch name>`
6. Create a pull request on Github, then merge the pull request into the main branch
7. Switch back to the main branch using `git checkout main`
8. Update your the main branch on your local machine by running `git fetch` and then `git reset --hard origin/main`
9. Go back to step 1!
