# Object Exercises

1. Create an object literal representing a person, with properties for their name, age, and favorite color. Use dot notation to access and print the value of each property.

2. Create two variables, x and y, where the value of x is 10 and the value of y is 20. Use object shorthand notation to create an object with properties for x and y.

3. Create a function constructor called "Book" that takes in a title, author, and number of pages as parameters. Use the "this" keyword to create properties for each of these values. Then, using prototypal inheritance (look back at the `prototype` property for function constructors), add a method to the constructor that prints the book's information to the console. Create multiple book objects and call the method on each book.

4. Create a class called "Car" with properties for the make, model, and year. Add a method to the class that prints the car's information to the console. Create an instance of the class and call the method to ensure it works correctly.

5. Create an object with multiple properties and nested objects. Access the nested objects and properties using both dot notation and bracket notation.

6. Create an object, add properties to it, and then delete a property from the object using the delete operator.

7. Create an object and use a for-in loop to iterate over its properties and print the key and value of each property to the console.

8. Create an object and use Object.keys() method to get an array of its keys and then iterate over this array and print the keys to the console.

9. Create an object and use Object.values() method to get an array of its values and then iterate over this array and print the values to the console.

10. Create an object and use Object.entries() method to get an array of its entries and then iterate over this array and print the entries to the console.
