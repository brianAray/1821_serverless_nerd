# React Testing Library Exercise 1 (Testing a Button Component)

## Description

This exercise involves writing tests for a Button component using React Testing Library.

## Approach

1. Create a new React component called Button that renders a button element with a text label passed as a prop.
2. Use React Testing Library to write test cases that verify that the Button component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. Write test cases that check the behavior of the Button component when clicked.

## Hints

1. Use React Testing Library's render function to render the Button component.
2. Use `getByRole` or `getByText` to query for the button element.
3. Use `fireEvent` to simulate user events, such as clicking on the button.

## Deliverables

1. A working Button component that renders a button element with a text label passed as a prop.
2. A set of test cases using React Testing Library to verify that the Button component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. A set of test cases that check the behavior of the Button component when clicked.

        - You do not need to wear professional clothes
- Introduce what you have done
- Explain how you approached it, and why you chose the decisions you did
- Talk about what you used in the exercise (React features) and why
- Provide a simple walkthrough, with first a demonstration of the component and then an explanation of its code
    - In the explanation, use technical keywords as much as possible instead of just descriptions
- Treat this as a product delivery to a manager
