# React Testing Library Exercise 3 (Testing a Form Component)

## Description

This exercise involves writing tests for a Form component using React Testing Library.

## Approach

1. Create a new React component called Form that includes multiple input elements.
2. Use React Testing Library to write test cases that verify that the Form component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. Write test cases that check the behavior of the Form component when the user submits the form.

## Hints

1. Use React Testing Library's render function to render the Form component.
2. Use `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, or `getByPlaceholderText` to query for the input elements.
3. Use `fireEvent.change` to simulate user input events on the input elements, and `fireEvent.submit` to simulate the form submission.

## Deliverables

1. A working Form component that includes multiple input elements.
2. A set of test cases using React Testing Library to verify that the Form component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. A set of test cases that check the behavior of the Form component when the user submits the form.

- Softskills and Presentation
    - Be centered on the camera
    - Look into the camera, not at the screen
        - This how you emulate eye contact while on camera
    - This should be professionally presented
        - You do not need to wear professional clothes
- Introduce what you have done
- Explain how you approached it, and why you chose the decisions you did
- Talk about what you used in the exercise (React features) and why
- Provide a simple walkthrough, with first a demonstration of the component and then an explanation of its code
    - In the explanation, use technical keywords as much as possible instead of just descriptions
- Treat this as a product delivery to a manager
