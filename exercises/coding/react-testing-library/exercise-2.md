# React Testing Library Exercise 2 (Testing an Input Component)

## Description

This exercise involves writing tests for an Input component using React Testing Library.

## Approach

1. Create a new React component called Input that renders an input element with a label and type passed as props.
2. Use React Testing Library to write test cases that verify that the Input component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. Write test cases that check the behavior of the Input component when the user types into the input.

## Hints

1. Use React Testing Library's render function to render the Input component.
2. Use `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, or `getByPlaceholderText` to query for the input element.
3. Use `fireEvent.change` to simulate user input events.

## Deliverables

1. A working Input component that renders an input element with a label and type passed as props.
2. A set of test cases using React Testing Library to verify that the Input component works correctly and contains the expected elements.
3. A set of test cases that check the behavior of the Input component when the user types into the input.

- Softskills and Presentation
    - Be centered on the camera
    - Look into the camera, not at the screen
        - This how you emulate eye contact while on camera
    - This should be professionally presented
        - You do not need to wear professional clothes
- Introduce what you have done
- Explain how you approached it, and why you chose the decisions you did
- Talk about what you used in the exercise (React features) and why
- Provide a simple walkthrough, with first a demonstration of the component and then an explanation of its code
    - In the explanation, use technical keywords as much as possible instead of just descriptions
- Treat this as a product delivery to a manager
