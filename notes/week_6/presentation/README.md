# Presentation

There should be an even distribution of talking. Everyone should talk consistently, and it should be done seamlessly, meaning, you should not be calling for "next slide" when you are done.

Practice your presentations, until the team is aware of what goes next without having to indicate it to each other. Rehearse your presentations, and ensure there are no issues during the live presentation.

This also includes, a thorough rehearsal of your demo. Typically you will only have 2 people in the demo, a single Driver and a single Narrator. The two should work together to rehearse, but what is covered during the demo can be decided with the team. 

Polish is what separates a professional to an amateur. 

For a technology presentation, the audience is assumed to be the product owners. This can be the client, or an internal department, or a governemnt project, etc. Generally, it is best to assume that the client is not aware of all of the technologies you are working, but may have a simple understanding of the basics.

## Pre-Demo

This is where you introduce yourselves and your project. In this phase, you want to primarily focus on the background. Why did you start this project, what brought you to it, who you are and what you brought to the project.

This is important, do not talk about the Team project as though it is a series of individual features. For the presentation, focus exclusively on the team aspect of it. We worked on X, we struggled with Y, etc. It's really important when you're working as a team and presenting as a team, that you maintain that unity.

If you want to talk about something you worked on, of course you can, just refer to it as a team. For example, if you did the login and registering feature, refer to it as the backend login feature, just say you worked on that feature. Don't say it was your feature. 

You can expand on your background or what you did in the introduction, or you can just say your name. Don't do a mix of both. 

If needed, have a slide which references what each person worked on:

- Backend Team
    - X
- Frontend Team
    - Y

After this you could display the technology.

- Backend Technology
    - Display a simple list of it

- Frontend Technology
    - Display a simple list of it

## Demo

A key aspect of the presentation, is the Demo. The demo has two major parts, the Driver, and the Narrator.

- Driver
    - This is the individual who is sharing their screen and is interacting with the application
- Narrator
    - This is the individual/group who is narrating over the drivers action

This should follow some kind of narrative. This is essentially the final stage of the user stories. You use user stories to describe the actions or behaviors a typical user wants to do with your application, the narrator then provides a hypothetical end user and narrates their thoughts and wishes over a drivers action.

This should follow some kind of story that is showing the features of an application off.

If your app has a social media portion, then describe how a user would think to use the app.
    - The user wants to post their most recent victory on a video game forum, they login/create an account,
        - While they are logging in you intentionally show a mistake the user could do, and then show how your application can handle it


After the demo has been completed, and the main features of the application are presented to the client. Then you can go into the details of the project.


## Post Demo

This is where you focus on the details of the project

Talk about features in as much depth as it makes sense to
    - Do not show any code
    - There are very few times where showing code in a presentation is a good idea

Focus on your plans and the execution behind them.
    - We planned to make this feature do this
        - When we started coding we came across these issues
        - We resolved them by doing this
            - Or we couldn't resolve them so we changed the plan

This should be focused on the development process, what happened during it and how you were able to get through it.


## Testing

Code Coverage, isn't a great metric for showing testing. It's pretty simple to get 100% code coverage without necessarily testing anything.

Instead, you should focus on showing results that are tangible to the client. API testing is great for this, but you should not show the Postman tests themselves, instead talk about them with screenshots.

Testing is never one aspect of a project, it is not just unit testing, and it is not just API testing. You should talk about it as a report, what was it you were looking to do, did you do it? How did it go? What were the results.


## Reflection

In general, this is a retrospective about the project. Here you can talk about the real issues, things you weren't able to do, things you wish you did, and what you all learned.

Make sure to present it.
