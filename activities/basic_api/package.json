  "description": "This activity involves using the Node.js `http` module, to create a basic API based on the grocery shopping tracker. Interactions between the client and the server will be managed using Postman, and HTTP requests. The user should be able to view, create, edit, and delete grocery items on the server. You can try to work with path parameters or query parameters as an optional aspect, but that process does not come easy with the node http module. The focus with this activity is building out a server, employing http, and logging your server activities.",
