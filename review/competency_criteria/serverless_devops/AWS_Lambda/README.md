## Requirements

| Priority     | Requirement                                                                                                           |

| Must Have    | I can explain the basics of how a Lambda Function works                                                              |
|     | I can explain and describe how a Lambda Function allows you to run code without a server                          |
|     | I can create a Lambda Function using the AWS Console                                                                 |
|     | I can set up IAM roles to allow my Lambda Function to interact with other AWS Services                            |
|     | I can set up an API Gateway with different endpoints                                                                 |
|     | I can trigger a Lambda Function with an API Gateway Endpoint                                                         |
| Should Have  | I can set up environment variables within my Lambda Function                                                         |
|   | I can use Lambda Layers to reduce the amount of packages needed to install                                          |
|   | I can use logging and monitoring with my Lambda Function and CloudWatch                                              |
|   | I can explain different Event Sources                                                                               |
|   | I can explain the issues with cold starts and performance problems with AWS Lambda                                  |
| Nice To Have | I can handle errors and do retries with my Lambda Function                                                           |
|  | I can integrate with other AWS Services and their event sources to create more complex applications                  |
|  | I can use a variety of testing with Lambda Functions to ensure code quality                                          |
